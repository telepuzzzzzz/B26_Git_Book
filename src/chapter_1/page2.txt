My beautiful book, I have been writing nonstop these past couple of days, it seems like I just keep throwing up my thoughts in this soulless bunch of zeroes and ones, how can one be so into himself and be so sure everyone else don't

I will never finish this book, because I never started it, it's all part of your own imagination, I'm just writing to let me thoughts flow free in the river of code, not for your personal enjoyment, what did you think?
